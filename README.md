# Game-Project
A game I built in my first java class.

# Instructions
Make sure that the code is in the same directory as the images folder. For specifics on how to play the game, click on the _How To Play_ button.

# Testing Mode
If you just want to look at the different parts of the game and do not care much about the gameplay, set `immortal = true` to make the player immune to enemy shots.
